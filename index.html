		<p>
			&nbsp &nbsp I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate of CS department at <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~lixia/">Prof. Lixia Zhang</a>.
			I am a doctoral researcher in the <a href="http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/index.html">Internet Research Laboratory (IRL)</a>.
			My main research interests fall into <strong>"/system/security"</strong>, including security and privacy enhancement in network system, distributed system, and data engineering.
			Especially, I am now an active research on <a href="https://named-data.net/">Named Data Networking (NDN)</a>.
			My ongoing research projects are <a href="https://ndn-lite.named-data.net/">smart home IoT system with localized and designed-in security</a>, Privacy-preserving Single SignOn protocol, Reliable Leaker Identification in Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Sharing, and Graph-based Permissioned Distributed Ledger.
		  </br>
			&nbsp &nbsp My previous work done in security includes Name-based Access Control over NDN, NDN Certificate Management and DDoS Defense over NDN.
			I am also contributing to the development of the core NDN softwares, including NDN Forwarding Daemon (NFD) and ndn-cxx library.
			</br>
			&nbsp &nbsp I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from <a href="http://nankai.en.school.cucas.cn/">Nankai University</a>, China, in 2016.
			While pursuing my bachelor degree, I was an undergraduate student research member in the Data and Knowledge Engineering Laboratory of Nankai University.
